**Hello! I'm Suqi. Welcome to my personal website!**

**I’m currently a master student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (香港中文大学), working under the guidance of Prof. Qiuqiang Kong.** My research focuses on end-to-end mono to spatial audio generation. Before joining CUHK, I earned my BSc in Computer Science from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (西交利物浦大学), where I was advised by Prof. Yin Cao and explored speech enhancement using generative models.

My primary research interests lie in speech and music processing as well as deep learning. Outside of academics, I am a passionate dancer, a Guzheng (a traditional Chinese instrument) player, and an aspiring painter. One day, I hope to bridge my dual passions for science and art, becoming a scientist who also creates art. My dream is to use deep learning to make the world more accessible for disabled individuals, enabling them to experience the sounds of life, while also helping people better enjoy and create music and art.

If my interests resonate with you, feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect! I’m also open to opportunities in speech and music processing. My journey has just begun, and I’m excited for what lies ahead. Let’s shape the future together! :smile:
